c
c        fgge=true if fgge mean tropospheric heating rates are used
c        trop=true if explicit tropospheric heating rates are used
c        chem=true if 24 level full chemistry is used
c        ozint=true if transported ozone feeds back via shine scheme
c        oztend=true if odd-oxygen tendencies are diagnosed and written
c        tavflw=true if time-averaged flow fields are generated
c        aerht=true if aerosol heating rates are included
c        sad3d=true if 3D time-dependent aerosol climatology is used
c        sadout=true if gridded SAD files are written
c        dohet=true if stratospheric heterogenous chemistry is included

c        NOTE: ozint=true makes no sense unless chem=true
