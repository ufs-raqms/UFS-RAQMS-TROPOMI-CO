   CCPP
      Model agnostic, vetted, collection of codes containing atmospheric physical parameterizations
      and suites for use in NWP along with a framework that connects the physics to host models

   *CCPP-Framework*
     The infrastructure that connects physics schemes with a host model; also refers to a software
     repository of the same name 

   *CCPP-Physics*
      The pool of CCPP-compliant physics schemes; also refers to a software repository of the same name

   Dynamic CCPP build
      A CCPP build type in which the *CCPP-Framework* and *CCPP-physics* libraries are
      dynamically linked to the executable and all CCPP-compliant schemes available in the library
      can be invoked at runtime. This build type is available for both the SCM and the UFS Atmosphere

   "Fast" physics
      Physical parameterizations that require tighter coupling with the dynamical core than “slow”
      physics (due to the approximated processes within the parameterization acting on a shorter 
      timescale) and that benefit from a smaller time step. The distinction is useful for greater
      accuracy, numerical stability, or both. In the UFS Atmosphere, a saturation adjustment is
      used in some suites and is called directly from the dynamical core for tighter coupling

   Group
      A set of physics schemes within a suite definition file (SDF) that are called together
      without intervening computations from the host application

   Group *cap*
      Autogenerated interface between a group of physics schemes and the host model. They are used
      only in the static CCPP build, and effectively replace the code from *CCPP-Framework* that
      provides the flexibility of the dynamic CCPP build

   Host model/application
      An atmospheric model that allocates memory, provides metadata for the variables passed into
      and out of the physics, and controls time-stepping

   Interstitial scheme
      A modularized piece of code to perform data preparation, diagnostics, or other “glue”
      functions that allows primary schemes to work together as a suite. They can be categorized
      as “scheme-specific” or “suite-level”. Scheme-specific interstitial schemes augment a
      specific primary scheme (to provide additional functionality). Suite-level interstitial
      schemes provide additional functionality on top of a class of primary schemes, connect
      two or more schemes together, or provide code for conversions, initializing sums, or
      applying tendencies, for example.

   Multi-suite static CCPP build
      A static CCPP build type in which a set of physics suites is specified
      at compile time from which one can be chosen at runtime.

   NEMS
      The NOAA Environmental Modeling System - a software infrastructure that supports 
      NCEP/EMC’s forecast products. The coupling software is based on ESMF and the NUOPC layer.

   NUOPC
      The National Unified Operational Prediction Capability is a consortium of Navy, NOAA,
      and Air Force modelers and their research partners. It aims to advance the weather
      modeling systems used by meteorologists, mission planners, and decision makers. NUOPC
      partners are working toward a common model architecture - a standard way of building
      models - in order to make it easier to collaboratively build modeling systems.

   Parameterization
      The representation, in a dynamic model, of physical effects in terms of admittedly
      oversimplified parameters, rather than realistically requiring such effects to be 
      consequences of the dynamics of the system (AMS Glossary)

   Physics *cap*
      Autogenerated interface between an individual physics scheme and the host model. Used
      only in the dynamic CCPP build

   Primary scheme
      A parameterization, such as PBL, microphysics, convection, and radiation, that fits the
      traditionally-accepted definition, as opposed to an interstitial scheme 

   PROD
     Compiler flags used by NCEP for operational runs of the UFS Atmosphere and by EMC for
     regression tests of the code 

   REPRO
     Compiler flags used by EMC to guarantee reproducibility of the UFS Atmosphere code

   Scheme
     A CCPP-compliant parameterization (primary scheme) or auxiliary code (interstitial scheme)

   SDF
     Suite Definition File (SDF) is an external file containing information about the 
     construction of a physics suite. It describes the schemes that are called, in which
     order they are called, whether they are subcycled, and whether they are assembled
     into groups to be called together

   Set
      A collection of physics schemes that do not share memory (e.g. fast and slow physics)

   "Slow" physics
      Physical parameterizations that can tolerate looser coupling with the dynamical core
      than “fast” physics (due to the approximated processes within the parameterization
      acting on a longer timescale) and that often use a longer time step. Such parameterizations
      are typically grouped and calculated together (through a combination of process- and 
      time-splitting) in a section of an atmospheric model that is distinct from the dynamical
      core in the code organization

   Standard_name
      Variable names based on CF conventions (http://cfconventions.org) that are uniquely
      identified by the *CCPP-compliant* schemes and provided by a host model

   Static CCPP build
      A build type in which the *CCPP-Framework* and the *CCPP-physics* libraries
      are statically linked to the executable and only the suites determined at compile time
      can be invoked at runtime. This build type is only available for the UFS Atmosphere

   Subcycling
      Executing a physics scheme more frequently (with a shorter timestep) than the rest of
      the model physics or dynamics

   Suite
      A collection of primary physics schemes and interstitial schemes that are known to work
      well together

   Suite *cap*
      Autogenerated interface between an entire suite of physics schemes and the host model.
      They are used only in the static CCPP build and consist of calls to autogenerated group
      caps. They may be used to call an entire suite at once or to call a specific group within
      a physics suite

   UFS
      A Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth
      system modeling system. The UFS numerical applications span local to global domains
      and predictive time scales from sub-hourly analyses to seasonal predictions. It is
      designed to support the Weather Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA's
      operational numerical weather prediction applications

   UFS Atmosphere
      The atmospheric model component of the UFS. Its fundamental parts are the dynamical
      core and the physics

   VLab
      Virtual Laboratory - a service and information technology framework, that enables
      NOAA employees and their partners to share ideas, collaborate, engage in software
      development, and conduct applied research (https://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/vlab/)
