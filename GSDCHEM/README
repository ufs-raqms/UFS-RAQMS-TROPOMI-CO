 ESRL/GSD GOCART component, v. 0.8.6

How to build on Theia
=====================

This package is meant to be included in NEMS as a component coupled to FV3GFS.
For the purpose of development, this software is currently linked to the coupled
NEMS app FV3GFS-GSDCHEM.

(a) To build within NEMS
------------------------

1. Type either:

   NEMS/NEMSAppBuilder (legacy script)

   Configuration options for this component can be added to the NEMS/NEMSAppBuilder
   script inside function build_gsdchem(). 

2. or, recently:

   cd NEMS/
   gmake -j8 app=coupledFV3_GSDCHEM build            (fully coupled system)
   gmake -j8 app=coupledFV3_GSDCHEM build_GSDCHEM    (this component alone)

   Configuration options can be found in NEMS/src/incmake/component_GSDCHEM.mk

The full list of options can be retrieved
by typing 

  ./configure --help

in GSDCHEM root directory.


(b) To build as a static library
--------------------------------

This software can also be independently built as a static library. Please follow
the steps below:

1. cd GSDCHEM
2. module load intel impi netcdf esmf
3. ./configure
4. gmake

If successful, those steps will produce the src/chem/libgsdchem.a static library file.

NOTES:
a. The module esmf will set the ESMFMKFILE environment variable to
   the location of ESMF Makefile fragment with build settings for your ESMF installation.

   If ESMFMKFILE was not defined, you may provide the location of your ESMF Makefile
   fragment to configure as:
   ./configure --with-esmfmk=<path-to-esmf.mk>

b. For Intel Fortran compilers, the configure option --enable-safe-fp is on by default
   for both the Fortran and NUOPC versions.
   This option enables safe-value floating-point optimization that will ensure that
   single- and multiple-processor runs will produce identical results.
   To disable this default option, please use:

   ./configure --enable-safe-fp=no
   or:
   ./configure --disable-safe-fp

c. Debug flags can be added by using:

   ./configure --enable-debug
